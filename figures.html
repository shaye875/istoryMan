                Solomon's Temple, also known as the First Temple (Hebrew: בַּיִת רִאשׁוֹן, romanized: Bayyit Rīšōn,
                lit. 'First Temple'), was a biblical Temple in Jerusalem believed to have existed between the 10th and
                6th centuries BCE. Its description is largely based on narratives in the Hebrew Bible, in which it was
                commissioned by biblical king Solomon before being destroyed during the Siege of Jerusalem by
                Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 587 BCE.[1] No excavations are allowed on the Temple
                Mount, and no positively identified remains of the destroyed temple have been found. Most modern
                scholars agree that the First Temple existed on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem by the time of the
                Babylonian siege, and there is significant debate among scholars over the date of its construction and
                the identity of its builder.

                The Hebrew Bible, specifically within the Book of Kings, includes a detailed narrative about the
                construction's ordering by Solomon, the penultimate ruler of the United Kingdom of Israel. It further
                credits Solomon as the placer of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies, a windowless inner
                sanctum within the structure.[2] Entry into the Holy of Holies was heavily restricted; the High Priest
                of Israel was the only authority permitted to enter the sanctuary, and only did so on Yom Kippur,
                carrying the blood of a sacrificial lamb and burning incense.[2] In addition to serving as a religious
                building for worship, the First Temple also functioned as a place of assembly for the Israelites.[3] The
                First Temple's destruction and the subsequent Babylonian captivity were both events that were seen as a
                fulfillment of biblical prophecies and thus affected Judaic religious beliefs, precipitating the
                Israelites' transition from either polytheism or monolatrism (as seen in Yahwism) to firm Jewish
                monotheism.[3][original research?]

                Previously, many scholars accepted the biblical narrative of the First Temple's construction by Solomon
                as authentic. During the 1980s, skeptical approaches to the biblical text as well as the archaeological
                record led some scholars to doubt whether there was any Temple in Jerusalem constructed as early as the
                10th century BCE.[4] Some scholars have suggested that the original structure built by Solomon was
                relatively modest, and was later rebuilt on a larger scale.[5] No direct evidence for the existence of
                Solomon's Temple has been found.[6][7] Due to the extreme religious and political sensitivity of the
                site, no recent archaeological excavations have been conducted on the Temple Mount. Nineteenth and
                early-twentieth century excavations around the Temple Mount did not identify "even a trace" of the
                complex.[8] Two 21st century findings from the Israelite period in present-day Israel bear resemblance
                to Solomon's Temple as it is described in the Hebrew Bible: a shrine model from the early half of the
                10th century BCE in Khirbet Qeiyafa; and the Tel Motza temple, dated to the 9th century BCE and located
                in the neighbourhood of Motza within West Jerusalem.[9][10] The biblical description of Solomon's Temple
                also appears to share similarities with several Syro-Hittite temples of the same period discovered in
                modern-day Syria and Turkey, such as those in Ain Dara and Tell Tayinat.[11][12] Following Jewish return
                from exile, Solomon's Temple was replaced with the Second Temple
